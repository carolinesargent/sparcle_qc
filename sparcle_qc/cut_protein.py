    DESCRIPTION

        Fragments a ligand@protein system and prepares F-/ISAPT input & accompanying fragment
        files.

    USAGE

        pocketfrag [, [split, [monoC, [prep_fisapt]]]]
    
    ARGUMENTS

        split : how to split the protein subsystem.
            Options: "residues", "sidechains" or "ss"
            Default: "sidechains"

        monoC : selection expression for defining ISAPT "monomer C", if any
            Default: None

        prep_fisapt : Boolean for whether or not to prepare F-/ISAPT input & fragment files
            Default: False

        cutcap : bool **EXPERIMENTAL** 
            Carve out the A:B:C subset from the entire protein by cutting bonds to anything
            else, and capping with the naive PyMOL cmd.h_add()
            Default: False

    NOTES

        * Specifics of the fragmentation scheme implemented herein are consistent with the
        original application of F-SAPT to protein-ligand binding by R. M. Parrish
        (Chem. Eur. J. 2017, 23, 7887â€“7890; doi: 10.1002/chem.201701031)
    
        * By default, the ligand is considered F-SAPT monomer A, the protein is considered
        F-SAPT monomer B, and any atoms satisfying the selection expression passed for the
        `monoC` argument are considered ISAPT monomer C.

        * A disulfide bridge between two cysteine residues is split into its own sidechain
        by cutting across the CA-//-SG bond, --S...S--, labeled according to the smaller
        residue ID (resi) of the two residues being bridged

        * If splitting on residues (`split="residues"`):
            * __**DANGER**__: Peptide bonds are cut between C and N, i.e., ...CA-C-//-N-CA...,
            which have partial double bond character!! This should only be done by advanced
            users who know _exactly_ what they're getting into!!

        * If splitting on sidechains:
            * atoms CA are included in the sidechain, not the backbone
            * peptide bonds are included as their own functional groups, labeled according
            to the smaller residue ID (resi) of the two residues being connected

        * If declaring monomer C using a "beyond `cutoff`" or "be. `cutoff`"  selection
        expression:
            * the full sidechain is included in the protein "pocket" for any residue with
            any atom within the cutoff distance of the ligand
            * peptide bonds connecting included sidechains and monomer C are _not_ included
            in the pocket, i.e., the single bond connecting the sidechain (monomer B) and
            backbone CA (monomer C) is cut.
    
    EXAMPLES
